# 1200C Vex Code

This project consists of my Vex Code that I created throughout High School. During my 8th grade year, I started to learn basic functions and programming concepts, and very gradually grew on to more advanced topics, and grew my passion for CS. Some of my prouder accomplishments were: utilizing cyclic lists in an LCD Menu; using PID loops to control motors to more accurately control the position of a robot, and using structs to implement several factors, including an acceleration factor that limited how fast the motors could speed up; and using trapezoidal integration approximation to more accuratedly determine the heading of a gyro sensor. Trying to create a system that wrote down the state of the joystick to play back the systems autonomously was a cool idea, but was ultimately unsuccessful (RecorderLib).

Furthermore, I apologize, I did homebrew version control on this software - as in I have about 50 folders with different versions of my code. The most up to date code is available here

## Using This Code

To run this code, you will need the RobotC IDE, as I believe it is the only possible way to compile RobotC code. The RobotC IDE can be downloaded at (http://www.robotc.net/download/vexrobotics/). You will also need a Vex Cortex to run the code on, however, ou can run the code on a virtual system, and should be put on a Robot with Vex motors and sensors. Furthermore, this code is tuned to the robot of team 1200C from the year 2016-2017, and should not be directly compiled onto your robot.
